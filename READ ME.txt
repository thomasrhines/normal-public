For Assignment 1 (the dorm and meal plan ):

I was planning to use different cases, similar to the JSpinner implementation for the combo boxes.
However, I ran it through GPT to identify an error I had with initializing the arrays inside or outside of the constructor.
I fixed that, but I also saw a method using an if-else statement to check the string literals of the combo boxes and decided to use that instead.

For Assignment 2 (the travel expenses):

I believe there is probably a better way to handle the layouts, but I decided to use GridBagLayout as it was in Zybooks and in Assignment 1.
I eventually saw that you could run a for loop through the components and place them that way, but I discovered that after I had already completed the program.
The program uses formatted text fields instead of regular ones; 
I chose to use them just to try it and to have an easier way of throwing an exception to the user for a bad value input.
For the text fields I wasn't sure what to put as the default text. I went with "$ _ _" which will require the user to overide it when inputting a value.

In General:
I didn't format it with the honor coded and the details like you said in class.
The documentation I did  provide is to make it easier to read especially assignment 2
The submitted word documentat will have the screenshot result and I will  submit with zip file thorugh csm and through github
